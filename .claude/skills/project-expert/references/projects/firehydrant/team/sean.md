# Sean Wilson

**Role**: SRE Engineer / Manager
**Team**: Applications
**Products**: Applications team products (slug: "aplications")

## Learning Style
- Self-directed learner — tries things himself before asking for help
- Technically curious — asked about slugs, tested the AI review agent himself
- Shares knowledge proactively with the team (webhook curl commands, Confluence templates)
- Prefers understanding the system over just getting the answer

## Strengths
- Most technically engaged team member
- Proactively helps others (helped Brett with GitHub SSO, shared webhook testing curl command)
- Creates documentation for the team (Confluence template for manager checklist)
- Submits clean PRs with good descriptions and Jira references
- Tests things independently ("I'm actually going to go check and make sure I get the same answer from the agent")

## Growth Areas
- Product slug discovery (initially didn't know how to find them — resolved quickly when shown)
- May need more depth on Terraform state management concepts as the project grows
- GitHub SSO migration affected him (had to re-auth with gh auth login) — resolved independently

## Recurring Patterns
- **Helpful to peers**: Consistently offers to help others (Brett's access, webhook testing). Could be a force multiplier for the team.
- **Quick learner**: When shown the slug pattern (data/products/<slug>.yaml), immediately said "I should have tried that first" and went to verify with the AI agent.
- **Documentation instinct**: Created a Confluence template without being asked. Shows initiative in making things easier for the team.
