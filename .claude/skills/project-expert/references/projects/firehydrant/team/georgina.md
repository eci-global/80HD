# Georgina Kingsley

**Role**: Project Manager / Coordinator
**Team**: Cross-team (manages the FireHydrant onboarding rollout)

## Learning Style
- Not a technical contributor — manages the project timeline and coordination
- Communicates through checklists, deadlines, and status tracking
- Summarizes open issues for the group
- Schedules 1:1 sessions when Teams chat becomes unproductive

## Strengths
- Excellent at tracking progress and holding people accountable
- Created the manager sign-off spreadsheet and checklist process
- Recognizes when async communication isn't working and switches to synchronous (scheduled calls)
- Bridges between Travis (technical) and the SRE managers (operational)
- Summarized escalation policy gaps (PD vs FH) clearly with comparison format

## Growth Areas
- Doesn't interact with the technical system directly
- Relies on others to validate configuration

## Recurring Patterns
- **Status check cadence**: Regularly asks for progress updates from all managers
- **Deadline tracking**: Sets clear deadlines (webhooks by Dec 19, testing starts in January)
- **Escalation**: Flags blockers to Travis and management when things stall (Brett's access issue)

## Interaction Notes
- 2025-12-12: Checked if Travis was duplicating Sean's webhook work. Coordinated spreadsheet tracking.
- 2025-12-19: Identified escalation policy gaps between PagerDuty and FireHydrant. Detailed comparison of step differences and timing.
- 2025-12-30: Recognized the Blaze/Travis back-and-forth wasn't productive, suggested scheduling a call.
- 2026-01-06: Scheduled 30-minute 1:1 sessions between each manager and Travis to resolve final config issues.
